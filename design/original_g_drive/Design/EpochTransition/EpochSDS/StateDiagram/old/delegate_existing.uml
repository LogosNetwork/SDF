if received a pre-prepare message with e#_{i-1}, the core software shall (1) reject it by replying a pre-prepare reject message with a proper error code, 
(2) if the local node is the first primary of the transactions in the batch block in epoch_i, queue the transactions into its primary waiting list, (3) else (the local node is not the first primary of the transactions), queue the transactions into its secondary waiting list, and forward the pre-prepare message to its first primary in epoch_i if the first primary is a delegate-new-epoch_i.
