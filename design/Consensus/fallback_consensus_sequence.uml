note right of fp
    The Fallback Primary is a regular backup delegate that participates
    in consensus. After receiving a valid pre-prepare message, backup
    delegates will start a fallback timers with pseudo-random timeout
    values. If the primary delegate fails to proceed, the backup delegate
    who's timer expires first will act as a fallback primary and resume
    consensus for the primary that failed.
