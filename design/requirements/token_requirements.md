   <td>Overview: The token account capability is an extension to the conventional Logos Network's account architecture which allows for token issuance on the Logos Network. The token account contains various important token accounting settings that dictate the allowable operations on the tokens. Some settings are immutable while others can be configured post account opening. For example, if the total supply is set as immutable, then the token issuer cannot issue additional tokens post the initial issuance. The section below describes the detailed requirements for token account settings. Note that all commands are executed only when delegate consensus are reached.

  <tr>
   <td>Overview: Token accounts support many operations to facilitate with activities associated with issued tokens. There is a mutability flag for some of the settings to dictate whether certain operations can be performed on the account. For example, if the revocability mutability setting is set to false, then the token issuer cannot revoke an accountâ€™s balance. The section below provides details regarding supported operations and their dependencies.

   </td>
   <td>Each controller can be set to have different levels of privilege similar to a Linux file system - revocability. freezability, whitelist capability, burn capability, transaction fee setting and the ability to withdraw tokens/transaction fees. Mutability setting still overrides these privilege settings in the sense that if a mutability setting for revocability is set to FALSE, then even if revocability for a specific controller is set to TRUE, no funds can be revoked.

   </td>
   <td>For an account to be whitelisted, the whitelist setting must be set to TRUE in the token account first, then a non-token holding account can request whitelisting. After the request is executed, the token account can then whitelist the account by sending a request to the network. Only after both requests are executed, the account will have the token shown as whitelisted in its own account and it is then ready to receive funds.
