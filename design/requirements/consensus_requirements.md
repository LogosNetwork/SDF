   <td><strong>Transaction Request</strong>
   </td>

   </td>

  <tr>
   <td>Overview: When receiving a transaction request, a delegate can immediately process it, queue the request, forward it to another delegate, or reply immediately. In addition, when a delegate sees a request for the first time either as an individual request or in the batchblock of a pre-prepare message, it performs several validity checks.
<p>
Every request has a default primary, whose index can be computed from the ""Previous hash"" of the account, as defined in the IDD. E.g. the last 5 bits of the Previous hash is an integer (evenly distributed) in [0,31], which can be used as an index to find the primary. So based on the Previous hash field in the request (also in the account stored in the local database), every delegate can compute the index of the default primary. When a delegate receives a new request, if it is not the default primary, it will forward the request to the default primary. It also stores the request locally in the secondary waiting list and set a timer. When the timer expires, if the request has not been handled by the default primary, this delegate will handle it by moving the request to its primary waiting list.
<p>
Every delegate has two waiting lists, the primary waiting list and the secondary waiting list. The items in the primary waiting list will be used when creating a new batch state block. The items in the secondary waiting list have timers. When a timer expires, the item is moved from the secondary waiting list to the primary waiting list, so that it could be included in later batch state blocks."
